# Once Upon a Thyme Recipe Blog

## About this Project

This food blog was built using React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Sass, Bootstrap, Typescript, and more. It features user authentication to offer a seamless admin experience for simple manipulation of the site including creating, editing, and deleting recipes, managing the home page, customizing the "tags" (diet, ingredient, meal, etc.), and more. 

Logged in users without Administrator privleges will gain access to the ability to rate recipes, leave non-anonymous comments, and save recipes to their collection for later reference.

The home page features some of the website's popular recipes, a search bar, some background about the author, and more.

There is a page to browse all of the site's recipes, with the ability to filter them based on ingredient, meal type, diet, and more.

If you're in the mood for one specific cuisine, ingredient, meal, or diet, you can visit the respective page for that tag.

Admins can very easily customize what appears on these tag pages, via the admin panel. The admin panel also includes a dashboard to view the performance of each recipe (comments, saves, and ratings), and review each of the site's users.

The top of each recipe page highlights some of the key information about the recipe in a beautiful display.

The recipe itself is clear, easy to read, and features a sticky ingredients list to avoid having to scroll back to the ingredients while making each recipe.
