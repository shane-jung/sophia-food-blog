This is Sophia's recipe blog.

## Technologies Used

- React
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB

## Getting Started


1. Make sure you have Node.js & npm installed on your machine (I used [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install Node 19.2.0 and npm 9.6.4)
2. Clone the repository
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Start the server with `npm run dev`
5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser


## Other info
- Code is split into serverside and clientside code. 
- Server stuff happens in src/server and client stuff happens in src/client
- I can give you permissions to access the MongoDB database for the project. You should [make an account](https://account.mongodb.com/account/login?n=%2Fv2%2F642dea6cd89680769775f037&nextHash=%23metrics%2FreplicaSet%2F642decd15a83ea5ae84b6e7a%2Fexplorer%2FSophiaRecipeBlog%2FRecipes%2Ffind) if you don't have one.
- It's not very well organized right now but if you have questions let me know.
